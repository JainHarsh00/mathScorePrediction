# 🧮 Math Score Prediction Web App

This is a Machine Learning web application that predicts a student's **Math Score** based on several academic and lifestyle factors. The core idea behind this project wasn’t just prediction — it was to **learn how to structure and deploy ML models like a production-ready project**, moving beyond notebooks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web app takes in user input from a form and returns a predicted math score using a trained regression model. The entire machine learning pipeline — from data ingestion to prediction — is modularized using best practices.

## 📊 Features Used for Prediction

- **Gender** – Male or Female  
- **Race/Ethnicity** – Grouped categories  
- **Parental Level of Education** – From some high school to master’s degree  
- **Lunch** – Standard or free/reduced  
- **Test Preparation Course** – Completed or not  
- **Reading Score** – Out of 100  
- **Writing Score** – Out of 100

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Flask** for backend server
- **HTML/CSS + Jinja2** for frontend
- **Pickle/Dill** for model and pipeline serialization
- **Render** for deployment
- **UptimeRobot** to keep the app alive

## 🧠 Key Learnings

✅ Structuring a machine learning project into components  
✅ Creating and saving transformation pipelines  
✅ Building custom transformers for preprocessing  
✅ Managing exceptions and logging  
✅ Creating a Flask-based frontend and backend  
✅ Deploying on **Render’s free tier**  
✅ Using **UptimeRobot** to prevent the app from sleeping
